# burger-order-microservice

Team project for SWEN-549 - Engineering Cloud Software Systems.

## Description
This is a proof of concept and simulation in how AWS auto-scaling can be used to scale microservices and improve the time to complete well-defined tasks. A fast food order was used for the simulation.

All technical design documentation and presentations can be found in a privately shared Google Drive.

## Demo
In this demonstration, we show how long it takes to complete orders before and after auto-scaling kicks in. Each order is timed at the end with how long it took to complete. Each clip is scaled at 4x the original speed.
